      <h1>Our History</h1> 
      <p>
      Edukatel was founded in 2021 with the mission to provide students with access 
      to quality education and connect them with passionate educators. We started 
      with a handful of students and teachers, but our community has grown to 
      include thousands of learners and educators across the country. Over the years, 
      we have worked tirelessly to create a platform that brings together students 
      and teachers from diverse backgrounds and helps them achieve their academic goals.
